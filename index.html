Hawking was born on January 8, 1942, in Oxford, England. In 1963 he was diagnosed with ALS, a form of Motor Neurone Disease, and later confined to a wheelchair and forced to communicate via a computerised voice.
<br> But he continued his theoretical work and was outspoken on many things over much of his life.

<br> Tributes have been pouring in on social media for the scientist, who made complex science accessible to everyone in his 1988 bestselling book A Brief History of Time.            
<br>                
The British scientist, famed for his work on black holes, died peacefully at his home in Cambridge aged 76.
</BR>
The University of Cambridge, where Prof Hawking completed his PhD and went on to become Lucasian Professor of Mathematics - a role once held by Sir Isaac Newton - described him as "an inspiration to millions".
</BR>
Queues have formed at Gonville and Caius College - where Prof Hawking was a fellow for more than 50 years - to sign a book of condolence.
</BR>
Buckingham Palace said the Queen will be sending a message of condolence to Prof Hawking's family.
</BR>
Prof Hawking's children, Lucy, Robert and Tim, said in a statement: "His courage and persistence with his brilliance and humour inspired people across the world.
</BR>
"He once said, 'It would not be much of a universe if it wasn't home to the people you love'. We will miss him forever."
